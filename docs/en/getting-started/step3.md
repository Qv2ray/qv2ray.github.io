# Step 3: Importing Hosts into Qv2ray
Qv2ray supports many ways of importing your configuration. To get you started, we have just picked these most common use cases.

## VMess Link
> VMess links generally looks like this: `vmess://eyJ2IjoiMiIsxxxxqcC5x`...

Follow these steps to import them:
1. Click **Add** button in the main window, or import via [link](qv2ray://open/import/link) or [QR Code](qv2ray://open/import/qr).
2. In the **Import File** dialog, choose import source **VMess / QRCode**,
3. Paste your `vmess://` links into **Share Link** text box.
4. Click on **Import** button to finish.

:::tip Batched Import
You can import multiple `vmess://` links at a time. Make sure each VMess link takes its single line.
:::

:::warning Broken Links
Some broken `vmess://` links may fail to import, but it doesn't matter. The detailed error will be shown on the right side. Also, it won't stop other entries in a batched import.

## Subscription

> A subscription link usually looks like this: `https://some-airport.com/links/YjYyODk?sub=3`

To import a subscription, follow these steps:
1. Click **Subscriptions** button in the main window.
2. In the **[SubscribeEditor](qv2ray://open/group/connection)** dialog, click the **Add subscription** icon button at the left-bottom corner.
3. Click to select the newly generated item in **Subscription List**.
4. Input your subscription information on the right side.
   - **Subscription Name**: Fill this as you wish.
   - **Subscription Address**: Use your subscription link mentioned above.
   - **Update Interval**: Change this according to your own demands.
5. Click **Update Subscription Data** button to update the subscriptions and wait until the process finishes.
6. Click **OK** to apply the settings and close the dialog.

::: tip Update through System Proxy
If you encounter connectivity problem with your subscription upstream (eg: DNS Record Pollution, IP Address Blocking, etc.), you may try to run with **Update Subscription with System Proxy** option on. However, it's better to inform the upstream as soon as possible, to fix the issue permanently.
