# Step 1: Obtaining Qv2ray

To get started with Qv2ray, you should first obtain it (Why not?).

- We offer many distribution methods, you can choose according to your preference.

## From a Package Manager

### Linux: Debian, Ubuntu and their derivatives

1. Install the relevant tools.

	```bash
	# apt install gnupg ca-certificates curl
	```

2. Follow the steps at [our debian repo](https://qv2ray.net/debian) or [debian dev repo](https://qv2ray.net/debian-dev)


3. Install Qv2ray

	```bash
	# apt update; sudo apt install qv2ray
	```

### Linux: Arch Linux and distros using Arch Linux's repo directly

**Install directly from `archlinuxcn`**

We have made ourselves into `archlinuxcn` repository. If you are already using it, simply type in your terminal:

Arch Linux CN Repo: <https://www.archlinuxcn.org/archlinux-cn-repo-and-mirror/>

```shell
sudo pacman -Syy qv2ray # or qv2ray-dev-git, see below.
```

And that shall be done.

**Download from AUR, using an AUR Helper**

You may acquire officially maintained `PKGBUILD` file from AUR (Arch User Repository, [AUR (en) - Home](https://aur.archlinux.org/)), which will instruct the build process of Qv2ray.

All Qv2ray plugins are currently in AUR.

### Linux: Manjaro

**Install directly from `manjarocn`**

Manjaro CN Repo: <https://github.com/manjarocn/repo>

```shell
sudo pacman -Syy qv2ray # or qv2ray-dev-git, see below.
```

### Linux: openSUSE / Fedora / CentOS

> Qv2ray is made available for openSUSE / Fedora / CentOS users from [openSUSE Build Service](https://build.opensuse.org) by [@zzndb](https://github.com/zzndb).

:::warning Applicable Versions

Because of the limit of Qt version, we may not be able to support all on-lifetime distro above, the detail of supported distro please check the OBS link below.

:::

Similar to AUR, there are two versions of Qv2ray available. You can choose according to your own flavor:

- Stable OBS: [Qv2ray](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:zzndb:Qv2ray/Qv2ray)
- Preview OBS: [Qv2ray-preview](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:zzndb:Qv2ray/Qv2ray-preview)

Or you can get more detailed installation guide directly from the links below:

- Download Preview: [Qv2ray-preview](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Azzndb%3AQv2ray&package=Qv2ray-preview)

:::warning For CentOS user

Before you install Qv2ray from above OBS project, you need to add the **EPEL** repository which provided by Fedora for extra needed dependencies. For more info please check the [Fedora EPEL Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).

After installing Qv2ray through project's repository (not download & install by hand), you can directly install plugins (with the same name of the plugin's project name, also provide the preview version plugin with `-preview` postfix) using your package manager.

## GitHub Releases Binary

Downloading the release from [Qv2ray Release Page](https://github.com/Qv2ray/Qv2ray/releases) is favored for someone who ***does not want to use Package Managers***.

This is also suitable for Linux users where Qv2ray is not officially packaged in their distros.

Do as the follows:

1. Navigate to [Qv2ray GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/Qv2ray/Qv2ray/releases) in a **web** browser.
2. Choose a version from the releases. Or, optionally, you may use the [Latest **Stable** Release](https://github.com/Qv2ray/Qv2ray/releases/latest).
3. Choose in Assets according to your platform and download it! For example:
   - For Windows Users:
     - Windows 7/8/8.1/10 x64: `Qv2ray.VERSION.Windows-x64.7z` (Archive) or `Qv2ray.VERSION.win64.exe` (Installer).
     - Windows 7/8/8.1/10 x86: You may try to build Qv2ray yourself.
     - Windows Vista/2003/XP/2000/ME/98/...: ***Are you kidding me bro?***
   - For Linux x64 Users: `Qv2ray.VERSION.linux-x64.AppImage`.
   - For macOS Users:
     - macOS 10.14 and later: `Qv2ray.VERSION.macOS-x64.dmg`;
     - macOS 10.13: `qv2ray-legacy.dmg` (if any);
     - macOS 10.12 and before: ***Try Upgrading Your macOS*** or installing Linux on your Apple device(s).

:::tip Notes for Linux AppImage users

Although we have bundled `glibc` and some basic C++ libraries into the **AppImage** package to support some old but supported distros, moving yourself to a newer version of Distro/OS is strongly recommended.

:::

:::warning Notes for Windows ARM64 users

Windows 10 on ARM added an emulation layer for x86_64 apps in *build 21277*, users can use the x64 version with the latest Windows Insider Preview.

## GitHub Actions

If you are fed up with the functionalities of stable versions and willing to try out new features in development, you may download artifacts from GitHub Actions:

1. Open [Qv2ray GitHub Actions Page](https://github.com/Qv2ray/Qv2ray/actions) in your web browser.
2. Choose a recent and successful (displayed as ✔️) build and click on it. You should be taken to the detail page of that GitHub Build. Here's [an example](https://github.com/Qv2ray/Qv2ray/commit/de88bfc69e50bf7c4ce034756720bf06df42612a/checks?check_suite_id=377218225).
